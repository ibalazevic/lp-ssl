Wide ResNet code taken from https://github.com/szagoruyko/wide-residual-networks/tree/master/pytorch.

Normalising flow code taken from https://github.com/karpathy/pytorch-normalizing-flows for the classification experiments and https://github.com/bayesiains/nflows for the image-to-image experiments.

Image-to-image translation code coming soon...
